# kafka-firehose-nozzle

`kafka-firehose-nozzle` is [CloudFoundry (CF) nozzle](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/loggregator/architecture.html#nozzles) for [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/). It consumes data from the Loggregator Firehose and then publishes it to Apache Kafka. 

The firehose generates events which are defined on [dropsonde-protocol](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/dropsonde-protocol). You can set Kafka topic for each event type (e.g., by default, `LogMessage` events are publish to `log-message` topic). Events are encoded in [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) between CF components but when to publish to kafka, events are decoded to plain json text.

`kafka-firehose-nozzle` is written by Golang and built with [rakutentech/go-nozzle](https://github.com/rakutentech/go-nozzle) package.

```bash
