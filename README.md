# kafka-firehose-nozzle

[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/rakutentech/kafka-firehose-nozzle.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/rakutentech/kafka-firehose-nozzle) [![Go Documentation](http://img.shields.io/badge/go-documentation-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](http://godoc.org/github.com/rakutentech/kafka-firehose-nozzle)

`kafka-firehose-nozzle` is a [CloudFoundry (CF) nozzle](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/loggregator/architecture.html#nozzles) for [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/). It consumes data from the Cloud Foundry Firehose and publishes it to one or more Apache Kafka topics.

You can set Kafka topic for each event type (e.g., by default, `LogMessage` events are publish to `log-message` topic). Events are decoded from the [dropsonde protobuf format](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/dropsonde-protocol) and published to Kafka encoded in the [sonde-go JSON format](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/sonde-go/tree/master/events).

`kafka-firehose-nozzle` is written in Go and uses the [rakutentech/go-nozzle](https://github.com/rakutentech/go-nozzle) package.

It can be used together with [rakutentech/cf-metrics-refinery](https://github.com/rakutentech/cf-metrics-refinery) to build a reliable pipeline that allows users to monitor their applications via a InfluxDB/Grafana installation.

## Usage

```bash
$ kafka-firehose-nozzle [options]

```bash
-config PATH       Path to configuraiton file

-debug             Output event to stdout instead of producing message to kafka
-log-level LEVEL   Log level. Default level is INFO (DEBUG|INFO|ERROR)

## Install

To install, you can use `go get` command,

```bash
$ go get github.com/rakutentech/kafka-firehose-nozzle
